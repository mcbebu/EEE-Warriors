## ninja_walkers

Ninja walkers aim to load balance the workload of delivery drivers by allowing commuting ninjas, regardless of mode of transportation, (whether by train, bus, bicycle or foot) to deliver parcel within the proximity of their destination. By centralizing Ninja points, Ninja drivers can offload small-medium sized parcels/packages for our walkers to deliver it on their way to their destination. Ninja walkers will receive a fixed amount of payout for each successful delivery and incentives are paid out in a tiered basis. Only higher tiered walkers can deliver higher valued parcels. 

Ninja walker partners with all members of public, only limited to age. 

Ninja walker is easy to sign up. Simply register for an account and install the app.
