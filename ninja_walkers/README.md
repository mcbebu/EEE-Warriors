# Ninja Walkers

Ninja walkers aim to load balance the workload of delivery drivers by allowing commuting ninjas, regardless of mode of transportation, (whether by train, bus, bicycle or foot) to deliver parcel within the proximity of their destination. By centralizing Ninja points, Ninja drivers can offload small-medium sized parcels/packages for our walkers to deliver it on their way to their destination. Ninja walkers will receive a fixed amount of payout for each successful delivery and incentives are paid out in a tiered basis. Only higher tiered walkers can deliver higher valued parcels. 

Ninja walker partners with all members of public, only limited to age. 

Ninja walker is easy to sign up. Simply register for an account and install the app. 

## How to use the app?
Walkers are able to filter the location based on their desired destination's address or postal code. Prior to the day of delivery, job postings will be posted on the app's catalogue on midnight for walkers to reserve the parcel which they can deliver. The exact block of delivery will be red-pinned for seamless user experience. Walkers are required to upload an image of the parcel before and after delivery. Delivery instructions can be found under "Chat" page, where walkers can view the instructions left by receiver. On the Walker's "Profile" page, they will have a dynamic QR code unique to their particulars. They are required to scan upon collection of parcel to deliver.
